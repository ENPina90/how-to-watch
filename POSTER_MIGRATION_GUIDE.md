# 🔄 Poster Migration Guide

## 🎯 **What It Does**

This system migrates existing entries that use URL-based posters (`entry.pic`) to Active Storage attachments (`entry.poster`) hosted on Cloudinary. This provides:

- ✅ **Better Performance** - Images served from Cloudinary CDN
- ✅ **Automatic Optimization** - Cloudinary handles compression and formats
- ✅ **Reliability** - No more broken external image links
- ✅ **Consistency** - All images managed through Active Storage

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Check Migration Status**
```bash
rails posters:check
```
Shows how many entries need migration.

### **Migrate All Entries**
```bash
rails posters:migrate
```
Migrates all entries with pic URLs but no poster attachments.

### **Migrate Specific List**
```bash
rails posters:migrate_list[123]
```
Migrates only entries from list ID 123.

## 📋 **Available Commands**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rails posters:check` | Check how many entries need migration |
| `rails posters:migrate` | Migrate all entries |
| `rails posters:migrate_list[ID]` | Migrate specific list |
| `rails posters:test_entry[ID]` | Test migration for single entry |
| `rails posters:help` | Show usage examples |

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

### **Migration Process:**
1. **Find Candidates** - Entries with `pic` URLs but no `poster` attachment
2. **Validate URL** - Check if the image URL is accessible
3. **Download Image** - Fetch the image from the URL
4. **Upload to Cloudinary** - Store as Active Storage attachment
5. **Preserve Original** - Keep `pic` URL as fallback

### **Smart Selection:**
```ruby
# Only processes entries that need migration
Entry.where.not(pic: [nil, ""])              # Has pic URL
     .left_joins(:poster_attachment)         # Left join attachments
     .where(active_storage_attachments: { id: nil })  # No attachment exists
```

### **Safe Migration:**
- ✅ **Non-destructive** - Original `pic` URLs are preserved
- ✅ **Validation** - URLs are tested before download
- ✅ **Error handling** - Failed migrations are logged, process continues
- ✅ **Rate limiting** - Small delays between requests

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **Programmatic Usage**
```ruby
# Individual entry
entry = Entry.find(123)
result = entry.migrate_poster!
puts result[:message]

# Batch migration
service = PosterMigrationService.new
results = service.migrate_all_posters(show_progress: true)
```

### **Web Interface**
- Visit any entry page
- Click "Migrate Poster" button (you'll need to add this to views)
- System downloads and uploads automatically

## 📊 **Example Output**

### **Migration Progress:**
```bash
🔄 Found 150 entries with pic URLs but no poster attachments...
[1/150] (0.7%) Migrating: The Matrix...
   ✅ MIGRATED: The Matrix -> poster_1699123456.jpg
[2/150] (1.3%) Migrating: Fight Club...
   ✅ MIGRATED: Fight Club -> fight_club_poster.jpg
[3/150] (2.0%) Migrating: Broken Movie...
   ❌ FAILED: Broken Movie - Pic URL is not accessible
```

### **Final Results:**
```bash
📊 Migration Results:
   Total entries processed: 150
   ✅ Successfully migrated: 142
   ⏭️  Skipped (already have poster): 5
   ❌ Failed to migrate: 3
   💥 Errors: 0

⏱️  Migration completed in 45.23 seconds
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **File Naming:**
- **From URL**: Extracts original filename if available
- **Generated**: Creates `poster_[timestamp].jpg` if no filename
- **Extensions**: Preserves original extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp)

### **Content Type Detection:**
```ruby
# Automatic detection based on URL extension
'.jpg' / '.jpeg' → 'image/jpeg'
'.png'           → 'image/png'
'.gif'           → 'image/gif'
'.webp'          → 'image/webp'
# Default        → 'image/jpeg'
```

### **Error Handling:**
- **HTTP Errors** - Invalid URLs, 404s, timeouts
- **Format Errors** - Invalid image formats
- **Network Errors** - Connection issues
- **Storage Errors** - Cloudinary upload failures

## 🎯 **Migration Strategy**

### **Recommended Approach:**

1. **Check First**:
   ```bash
   rails posters:check
   ```

2. **Test Single Entry**:
   ```bash
   rails posters:test_entry[123]
   ```

3. **Migrate Small List**:
   ```bash
   rails posters:migrate_list[small_list_id]
   ```

4. **Full Migration**:
   ```bash
   rails posters:migrate
   ```

### **Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Run during off-peak hours** for large migrations
- ✅ **Check Cloudinary storage limits** before large batches
- ✅ **Monitor progress** with the built-in progress indicators
- ✅ **Keep backups** of your database before major migrations

## 📈 **Expected Results**

### **Performance Improvements:**
- **Faster Loading** - CDN delivery vs external URLs
- **Better Reliability** - No more broken image links
- **Automatic Optimization** - Cloudinary handles compression
- **Responsive Images** - Cloudinary can serve different sizes

### **Success Rates:**
- **Typical Success Rate**: 85-95%
- **Common Failures**: Dead URLs, invalid formats, network timeouts
- **Safe Fallbacks**: Original `pic` URLs still work if migration fails

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### **Active Storage Configuration:**
```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
config.active_storage.service = :cloudinary

# config/storage.yml
cloudinary:
  service: Cloudinary
  folder: <%= Rails.env %>
```

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

### **Non-Destructive:**
- Original `pic` URLs are never deleted
- Display logic falls back to `pic` if `poster` fails
- Failed migrations don't affect existing functionality

### **Robust Error Handling:**
- Individual failures don't stop batch processing
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation for network issues

### **Progress Monitoring:**
- Real-time progress indicators
- Detailed success/failure reporting
- Timing information for planning

## 🎉 **Benefits After Migration**
