Despite Bulma's warning, Goku accidentally looks up at the full moon. However, at first, nothing seems to happen to Goku as he shrugs over a big deal, much to the group's confusion. But even though he turns away from the moon and his friends sigh in relief, something snaps in Goku: his eyes turn red, his heart beats loudly with increasing speed, and he begins growing with his clothes tearing apart, his body growing fur, his teeth becoming sharp, his ears pointing up, and his face growing a muzzle.
