The telepath storyline is probably the single most disliked thing about season 5 and I wanted to edit it down to the bare minimum. It turns out that it's actually a very good story when you remove most of the padding.

Most of the changes here are just to streamline the telepath story so Bester only visits the station once, the singing is almost non existent, and the telepaths are not recruited by Garibaldi (although he tries). I've also completely removed Lockley and Sheridan being married since it adds nothing to the plot—after it's revealed it's just forgotten.
