This wish is granted, Shenron disappears, and the seven balls scatter all over the earth. Furious, Pilaf sends Mai and Shu after Oolong and Puar, and noticing Goku, Yamcha and Bulma escape, he orders them executed. Many guard dogs suddenly appear: some chase Oolong and Puar and others corner Goku, Yamcha and Bulma. Goku and Yamcha beat these dogs to protect Bulma, and on their way out they find Oolong and Puar. Before they can leave, Mai and Shu corner them with another pack of dogs and themselves. They are transported to a room with a glass ceiling that gathers energy from the sun and heats up. By morning, just as Pilaf planned for revenge on his meddlers, they will be burnt alive. Goku and Yamcha try to break down the walls, but fail. Later that night, Puar is staring at the full moon while Oolong and Bulma argue over their last hope for escape. Goku tells the group about a huge monster that comes out when the moon is full. He said that the monster (though it was clearly Goku, but he is not aware of that) trampled his grandfather Gohan to death, and before that tragedy, Gohan told his grandson never to look at the moon. Alarmed with this detail, Bulma, Yamcha, Puar and Oolong believe that Goku was the monster and fear they will meet the same fate as his grandfather. Despite Bulma's warning, Goku accidentally looks up at the full moon. However, at first, nothing seems to happen to Goku as he shrugs over a big deal, much to the group's confusion. But even though he turns away from the moon and his friends sigh in relief, something snaps in Goku: his eyes turn red, his heart beats loudly with increasing speed, and he begins growing with his clothes tearing apart, his body growing fur, his teeth becoming sharp, his ears pointing up, and his face growing a muzzle.

Most of the changes here are just to streamline the telepath story so Bester only visits the station once, the singing is almost non existent, and the telepaths are not recruited by Garibaldi (although he tries). I've also completely removed Lockley and Sheridan being married since it adds nothing to the plot—after it's revealed it's just forgotten.
