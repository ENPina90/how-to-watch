I tried to envision what this would've looked like if it was a movie as originally intended as opposed to a stretched out miniseries. The majority of notable plot points are retained.
Reva is still there, but the last we see of her is getting stabbed on Jabim. It's implied that she's dead, but left ambiguous enough that she could show up for further adventures. The whole Lars farmstead sequence is excised.
I cut the training duel flashback, and many other instances of seeing Vader out of the suit. The only time I kept was when he and Kenobi are both in their bacta tanks. I think holding off on showing Anakin makes the broken helmet moment stronger. It also screams of ""scene that was cool that we cut that we can now add back in because it's a series""
